This simple trial of vue.js is our version of Hello World. It does not use a server or vue cli, which is needed for the full project.

This is a single-page application, eliminating the necessity to make frequent requests of the web server. It serves the customers of Research Publishers.

Note. Research Publishers LLC sells its books and case studies through booksellers and distributors, working in conjunction with the University of Chicago Press. All e-commerce transactions are executed online by software of that press and its distribution services. That is, research-publishes.com itself has no database or e-commerce functions. It does not collect customer information or process orders. This aspect of the website will remain intact at the conclusion of the current project.

Vue.js provides a structure for the front-end, which is the customer website. It is the new technology that we are exploring in the project. Vue.js includes templating tools, which may be used instead of Handlebars.
