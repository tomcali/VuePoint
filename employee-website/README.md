Here we develop a hosted, database-driven content management system for the Research Publishers' website. This will serve the employees who have the need to add new book titles, authors, and artists in the future.

Back-end technologies include JavaScript packages, including Node, Express, a relational database (SQLite3), and Sequelize. In addition to providing the initial hosted server location for the new website, these back-end technologies will be used to host the content management system.

To use, start up the backend by typing "nodemon server.js" on the command line.  The "Data Entry screen" is named index.js in the /public directory.  It can be accessed by the browser at http://localhost:8080
