Here we develop a hosted, database-driven content management system for the Research Publishers' website. This will serve the employees who have the need to add new book titles, authors, and artists in the future.

Back-end technologies include JavaScript packages, including Node, Express, a relational database (SQLite3 or MySQL), and Sequelize. In addition to providing the initial hosted server location for the new website, these back-end technologies will be used to host the content management system.

We develop hosted back-end content management system. Initial content in the system will be a clone of current website content. The system should provide an easy-to-use facility for adding new content to the website in the future. New content will update the database.
