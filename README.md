# Project Title: VuePoint
This is Bootcamp Project 2 Work. The name comes from Vue, which is one of many technologies used in completing the project.

## Team Members: John Johansen, Chris Ward, and Tom Miller

## Project Description
Research Publishers LLC is a publisher of books and research case studies. The company has a website at research-publishers.com that was designed more than ten years ago. It is a simple static site that relies on frequent client requests to the server. 

This project has two major components. (1) Develop a hosted, database-driven content management system for the Research Publishers' website.

(2) Convert the current multipage site to a single-page application, eliminating the necessity to make frequent requests of the web server. 

Note. Research Publishers LLC sells its books and case studies through booksellers and distributors, working in conjunction with the University of Chicago Press. All e-commerce transactions are executed online by software of that press and its distribution services. That is, research-publishes.com itself has no database or e-commerce functions. It does not collect customer information or process orders. This aspect of the website will remain intact at the conclusion of the current project.

## Technologies to be Used
Back-end technologies include JavaScript packages, including Node, Express, MySQL, and Sequelize. In addition to providing the initial hosted server location for the new website, these back-end technologies will be used to host the content management system.

Vue.js provides a structure for the front-end. It is the new technology that we are exploring in the project. Vue.js includes templating tools, which may be used instead of Handlebars.

## Rough Breakdown of Tasks
All members. Develop software/system specifications for the project.

John. Develop hosted back-end content management system. Initial content in the system will be a clone of current website content. The system should provide an easy-to-use facility for adding new content to the website in the future. New content will include information about publications, books and research studies.

Chris. Implement back-end hosted site on Heroku. Assist with front-end development and testing.

Tom. Lead in developing the Vue.js front-end application. Develop reveal.js browser-based presentation.
